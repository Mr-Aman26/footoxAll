# npm resolution error report

While resolving: footoxreact@0.1.0
Found: react@18.2.0
node_modules/react
  react@"^18.2.0" from the root project

Could not resolve dependency:
peer react@"^0.14.0" from react-rev-slider@1.0.1
node_modules/react-rev-slider
  react-rev-slider@"^1.0.1" from the root project

Fix the upstream dependency conflict, or retry
this command with --force or --legacy-peer-deps
to accept an incorrect (and potentially broken) dependency resolution.
